Description: Ensures a swapfile is created on Azure VM offering volitile temporary disk
 Temporary disk
 Every VM contains a temporary disk, which is not a managed disk.
 The temporary disk provides short-term storage for applications and processes and is intended to only store data such as page or swap files.
 Data on the temporary disk may be lost during a maintenance event event or when you redeploy a VM.
 On Azure Linux VMs, the temporary disk is /dev/sdb by default and on Windows VMs the temporary disk is D: by default.
 During a successful standard reboot of the VM, the data on the temporary disk will persist.
